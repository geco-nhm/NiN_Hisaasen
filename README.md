# NiN_His책sen
This repository contains two ecosystem-type maps at His책sen.

Area-wide ecosystem-type maps according to NiN generalize and reproduce the ecological structures in the landscape. Such maps can cover many purposes, but in this context two things in particular have been important: 1) the maps can be included in the training of new surveyors and 2) they can be included in the research that takes place at His책sen.

Two areas on His책sen in Eastern Norway have been mapped according to Nature in Norway's guide for mapping at a scale of 1: 20 000 (Bryn et al. 2018). Both area cover a total of 500x500m area centered around the flux towers of NVE.
For mapping in the field, we have used new orthophotos from Norway Digital, drone photos and field-PCs with adapted layouts in QGIS. The layout follows the system for teaching at the University of Oslo which is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/geco-nhm/NiN_QGIS_3.x) (Horvath et al. 2019). Both maps are digitally available in GitHub.
