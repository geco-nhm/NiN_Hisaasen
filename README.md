# NiN_Finse
This report briefly describes how two ecosystem-type maps at Finse were made. The results are presented in the form of maps and tables, as well as text that describes the ecology of the ecosystems.

Area-wide ecosystem-type maps according to NiN generalize and reproduce the ecological structures in the landscape. Such maps can cover many purposes, but in this context two things in particular have been important: 1) the maps can be included in the training of new surveyors and 2) they can be included in the research that takes place at Finse.

Two areas on Finse in Western Norway have been mapped according to Nature in Norway's guide for mapping at a scale of 1: 5000 (Bryn et al. 2018). One area is centered around the flux tower of the Meteorological Institute at the Alpine Research station (0.76 km2). The other area is located on Vesle Hansbunuten (1 km2), just south of Finsefetene.

For mapping in the field, we have used new orthophotos from Norway Digital, drone photos and field-PCs with adapted layouts in QGIS. The layout follows the system for teaching at the University of Oslo which is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/geco-nhm/NiN_QGIS_3.x) (Horvath et al. 2019). Both maps are digitally available in GitHub.
